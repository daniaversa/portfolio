# Dani Aversa - Portfolio
2019

This is the Udacity Front End Nanodegree first project - Build a Portfolio. I tried to keep it simple and Html+css only for being the topics of the respective lessons. My preference for the layout was the flexbox grid system, again, not to create unecessary dependancies and to create everything from scratch for even more understanding of layout design.
